    <a href="untitled19.mp3"><h3>Untitled 19</h3></a>
    <p>Untitled 19 is formed around a dichotomy of two musical ideas. We were interested in quoting material from kpop songs, so both of the main ideas are derived from a BLACKPINK song (bonus points to anyone who figures out which one). I'm not very familiar with kpop, so it was interesting to listen and learn more about it in the process of writing this piece!</p>

    <a href="untitled9.mp3"><h3>untitled9</h3></a>
    <p>Started working on this in 2022 (released 2024). Lots of quarter tones, but I think they're used pretty smoothly here.</p>

    <a href="untitled17.mp3"><h3>Untitled 17</h3></a>

    <a href="OrbitalMechanics.mp3"><h3>Orbital Mechanics</h3></a>
    <p>Solo piano piece based on the frequencies at which the planets orbit the sun in our solar system. Huge thanks to Mika Sasaki for performing this, it's very very difficult!</p>

    <a href="Xenexhibition.mp3"><h3>Xenexhibition</h3></a>
    <p>This piece is designed to serve as an introduction: to the sounds of pure chords, the sounds of microtonal modulation, and the sounds of subtle shifts in tuning of the same chord. It also explores some of the technical consequences of retuning and attempts to use these consequences in a musically convincing way.</p>

    <a href="untitled7.mp3"><h3>Untitled 7</h3></a>
    <p>Untitled 7, for brass octet. Thanks to Avery Hoerman, Jesse Saldaña, David Holloway, Ronan Emerson, Nick Wolfe, Justin Carrothers, Tim Wilson, JunMing Wen, and Elijah Buerk for performing this!</p>

    <a href="Piano_Trio.mp3"><h3>Piano Trio</h3></a>
    <p>Piece for (as implied by the name) Piano Trio. I would like to avoid giving too much away before you listen. But the structure of the piece emerges slowly and deliberately, almost imperceptibly, in an attempt to evoke a pure and sublime beauty, unencumbered by established styles. Recorded by the Neave Trio at 2022 Mostly Modern Festival!</p>
