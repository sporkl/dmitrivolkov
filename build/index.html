Dmitri Volkov’s work in computer science and music has been described as “interesting,” which he considers better than the alternative. As an award-winning composer, Dmitri aims to develop and apply experimental techniques, bringing forward the boundaries of music. He is also an accomplished violinist and multi-instrumentalist. Besides music, Dmitri is active in computer science, and has presented at conferences, contributed to textbooks, and produced successful commercial apps and plugins. 
</p>
<p>
Dmitri’s music composition awards include: NYC Contemporary Music Symposium finalist, RIOCC Organ Composition Competition Young Artist Division 1st Prize, ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Competition finalist. His pieces have been performed by members of major U.S. orchestras (including the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra), and chamber groups including the Neave Trio. His computer music work has been presented at the International Symposium for Quantum Computer Music, the Tui St. George Tucker Symposium, and the MOXsonic, SPLICE, and REF Resilience music festivals. His computer science research interests include programming language theory, quantum computing, and audio/music programming. Dmitri is a co-author of the first chapter of Advances in Quantum Computer Music, published by World Scientific. He develops Pivotuner, an audio plugin enabling adaptive pure intonation for virtual instruments, and the practice tool 2in1 Drone Metronome, alongside other apps and plugins. 
</p>
Dmitri holds degrees in music composition and computer science, with honors and highest distinction, from the Jacobs School of Music and Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University. He has also studied at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics and Music (IRCAM) in Paris. His composition instructors have included: Paul Frucht, Don Freund, P.Q. Phan, Aaron Travers, and Han Lash. For computer science, he has worked as a TA and researcher with Chung-chieh Shan and Daniel Friedman (known for “The Little Schemer” line of textbooks and for developing lazy evaluation). Dmitri is a member of Robert Goldstone’s Precepts and Concepts cognitive science research lab. Dmitri also wants you to know that he does not usually write in the third person.
